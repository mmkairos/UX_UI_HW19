    <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
      <a href="images\Survey.png"></a>
      <p>I thrive on problem solving and supporting an empathetic approach to execute user goals. Cart sorting, user testing and analytics are some of my favorite methods to find the best solutions.

  <h3>PROTOTYPING</h3>
    <a href="images\Mockup.png"></a>
    <p>Design should not only appeal aesthetically to users, it is critical to not only understand users but to also keep your goals aligned with user constraints and the context as a whole. Good design feels with the user.

  <h3>INFORMATIONAL ARCHITECTURE</h3>
    <a href="images\UserFlow.png"></a>
    <p>Qualitative interviews are a great tool to gain insight into improving findability and solutions allowing the user to "do what they came to do". Observing and listening to testers can improve any design process.
